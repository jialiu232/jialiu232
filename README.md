I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program in Iowa State University, Ames, IA. I am passionate about promoting sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture from the soil microbial perspective. More specifically, I am interested in improving the detection of soil microbiome functional genes related to important biogeochemical processes, such as nitrogen cycling. 

### Research projects

- Developed a command line tool (bash & python) that designs high-throughput qPCR primers for environmental specific functional genes of interest
- Systematically and statistically evaluate microbiome function prediction tool, PICRUSt2
- Investigate soil microbiome functions with deep learning

### Interests

- I enjoy working on and learning statistical analysis and data visualization, programming, and machine learning projects. Always look to collaborate on fun projects!
- I just started indoor climbing
